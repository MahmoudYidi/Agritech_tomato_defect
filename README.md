### Overview

This Anomaly Detector is a Python-based application designed to identify anomalous tomatoes using Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) data. The system leverages a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model in the backend to analyze reconstruction errors in the HSI tensor, highlighting potential anomalies with a user-friendly GUI While keeping track of the counts. The project summarises the paper presented at CVPPA
