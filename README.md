### Overview
# üçÖ Tomato Defect Detection with VAE & Hyperspectral Imaging

This project presents an unsupervised anomaly detection system for tomatoes using **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)** and **Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI)**. The system identifies defects such as dry splits by analyzing reconstruction errors in hyperspectral data, offering a non-invasive solution for quality control in agricultural settings.

## üî¨ Key Features

- **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes a tailored VAE model to detect anomalies in hyperspectral images without the need for labeled data.
- **Hyperspectral Imaging**: Analyzes spectral data in the 530‚Äì550 nm range to identify subtle defects in tomato skins.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to load hyperspectral images, run anomaly detection, and visualize results interactively.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays anomaly scores and highlights potential defects directly on the GUI.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing reconstruction errors and anomaly maps.
